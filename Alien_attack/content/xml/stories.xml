        I'm glad to welcome you! It has come to our attention that the Alias Brothers and their gang are hiding on our planet.                          
Your mission is to destroy these intergalactic thugs. They are hiding to the southeast near a lonely mountain. There's a cave there I think you can find them there.
Your planet needs you!
